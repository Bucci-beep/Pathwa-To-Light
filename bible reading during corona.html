                                                        <p class="mb-4">The Covid-19 pandemic has been on for the past few months with the medics in countries all over the world tirelessly looking for a vaccine. Even as they do so let us remember as Christians to read our Bibles each and every single day. The Bible offers guidance t othose who may lack it, it offers hope to the broken hearted. It calms and offers peace to the anxious.</p>
                                                        <p class="mb-4">We read the bible so we don’t start getting comfortable.

Make sure Christ is always first in your life. You don’t want to drift from Him.

Revelation 2:4 “Yet I hold this against you: You have forsaken the love you had at first.”

Romans 12:11 “Do not be slothful in zeal, be fervent in spirit, serve the Lord.”

Proverbs 28:9 “If anyone turns a deaf ear to my instruction, even their prayers are detestable.”</p>
                                                        <p class="mb-4">We read the bible to spend time with the Lord.

Proverbs 2:6-7 “For the LORD gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding. He holds success in store for the upright, he is a shield to those whose walk is blameless.”

2 Timothy 3:16 “All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness.”

                                                        <p class="mb-4">To guard yourself from false teachings and false teachers. 

1 John 4:1 “Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to determine if they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.”

Matthew 24:24-26 “For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect. Remember, I have told you ahead of time. So then, if someone says to you, ‘Look, he is in the wilderness,’ do not go out, or ‘Look, he is in the inner rooms,’ do not believe him.”</p>
                                                        <p class="mb-4">To do God’s will: It helps you obey God and not sin.

Psalm 119:9-12 “How can a young man keep his behavior pure? By guarding it in accordance with your word. I have sought you with all of my heart; do not let me drift away from your commands. I have stored what you have said in my heart, so I won’t sin against you. Blessed are you, LORD! Teach me your statutes.”

Psalm 37:31 “The law of his God is in his heart, and his steps shall not be supplanted.”

Psalm 40:7-8 “Then I said, “Look, I have come. As is written about me in the Scriptures: I take joy in doing your will, my God, for your instructions are written on my heart.”</p>
